# Internet Meme Guide App Business Plan

### 1.Target user group
  The original intention of developing this application is to respond to the current rapid iteration of the Internet and help people quickly understand the meaning of some popular new words on the Internet. Therefore, we originally hoped that the audience of this software would be mainly students. However, considering the current information gap between the youth and the elderly, we also hope that this software can help the elderly and the elderly adapt to the current Internet environment, shorten the information gap between the elderly and young people, and make it easier for the elderly to integrate into the current society. 
### 2.Sales Proposition
  Internet Meme Guide is a mobile app that helps users discover and share the most popular internet meme on the internet. The app is designed for people who love humor, satire, and viral content and want to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and memes. 
Our sales proposition is based on the following key features: 

- Curated content: Memes Guide features a carefully curated selection of the most popular and trending memes on the internet. Our team of content experts scours the web for the best and funniest memes and updates the app regularly with fresh content. 
- User-generated content: In addition to curated content, Memes Guide allows users to create and share their own memes with the community.      
Users can submit their memes, vote for their favorites, and participate in meme challenges and contests. 
- Social features: Memes Guide offers a range of social features, such as commenting, liking, and sharing memes with friends and followers.      
Users can also follow other users and create custom feeds based on their preferences. 
### 3.Marketing Channels
  To reach our target audience, we will use a variety of marketing channels, including: 
- Social media: We will use platforms such as weibo, tieba and weixin to share funny memes, engage with users, and promote the app's features and content. 
- Influencer marketing: We will partner with popular social media influencers, meme creators, and content creators to promote the app and reach a wider audience. 
- Search engine optimization: We will optimize our app's website and app store listings with relevant keywords and content to improve our visibility in search results. 
- Public relations: We will reach out to media outlets, bloggers, and journalists to feature our app in articles and reviews. 
  Through these marketing channels, we aim to build a strong brand presence, increase user engagement, and drive app downloads and subscriptions.    
  We will also use user feedback and data analytics to improve the app's features and content and ensure a satisfying user experience.  

### 4.Financial Key Metrics for Mobile App Business Plan
  First of all, our first version of the app will be targeted at the campus user community, and we hope that the number of users on campus can reach 500.
  Secondly, the optimized app will be promoted to social groups based on user feedback within the school. Our goal is to reach 3000 users through various promotion channels within a month.
  With the continuous promotion and continuous optimization of apps, we aim to reach more than 50000 users within one year.
  After the app matures, our goal is to maintain daily and monthly activity at 5000 and 15000.
  The main revenue of the app is advertising. We plan to try advertising when the user group is campus users. We conservatively hope that the revenue can maintain the development and maintenance of the app.
  After the app becomes available to the public, as the number of users increases, development and maintenance costs will also increase, and we will accept more advertising. The advertisements we place in the app will also be more suitable for different user groups. With more advertising revenue, we will invest more money in promotion after achieving revenue. Excluding all input costs, we aim to achieve a monthly revenue of over 100k yuan in one year. After the app matures, we hope that the target revenue will continue to grow.
